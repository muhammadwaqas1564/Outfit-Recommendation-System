# Outfit-Recommendation-System
AI-driven outfit classification system with future enhancements for personalized outfit recommendations.

Overview
The Outfit Recommendation System is designed to help users organize and categorize their wardrobe efficiently. It currently classifies clothing items based on key attributes such as category, color, and season. The future goal is to enhance the system with outfit recommendations using advanced machine learning techniques.

Key Features
  1. Data Organization: Classifies clothing items based on predefined attributes.
  2. Feature Engineering: Utilizes categorical data encoding and scaling for better classification.
  3. Machine Learning Model: Implements a decision tree classifier for clothing classification.
  4. Future Enhancements: Plans for personalized outfit recommendations and user interaction features.

Technical Components
  1. Programming Language: Python
  2. Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy
  3. IDE: Jupyter Notebook
  4. Dataset: CSV file containing clothing attributes

Workflow
  1. Data Preprocessing:
    1. Cleaning and handling missing values.
    2. Encoding categorical features (e.g., color, category, season).
    3. Splitting data into training and testing sets.
  2. Model Training:
    1. Training a decision tree classifier on labeled clothing data.
    2. Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, and recall.
  3. Future Enhancements:
    1. Implementing an outfit recommendation algorithm.
    2. Adding user feedback for personalized recommendations.
    3. Incorporating fashion rules and collaborative filtering for better styling suggestions.
